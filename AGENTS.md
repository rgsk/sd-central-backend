# Agent Instructions

- Before making any changes, run `git add .` in both repos:
  - `/Users/apple/Desktop/practice/projects/sd-central/sd-central-frontend`
  - `/Users/apple/Desktop/practice/projects/sd-central/sd-central-backend`
- On new user messages, run `git add .` first if you expect to make code changes; skip it only when the request is clearly just a question or suggestion with no edits.
- Keep changes separated by repo and do not stage after edits unless asked.
