# Agent Instructions

- Before making any changes, run `git add .` in both repos:
  - `/Users/apple/Desktop/practice/projects/sd-central/sd-central-frontend`
  - `/Users/apple/Desktop/practice/projects/sd-central/sd-central-backend`
- Keep changes separated by repo and do not stage after edits unless asked.
